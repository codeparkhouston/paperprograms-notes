_with [Wanjun], [Amanda], and [Shaun]_

For our first session, we met at Wanjun's apartment. Amanda had
familiarized herself with the setup process the night before, and Wanjun had
a space in her apartment cleared out and ready.

We got flying pretty quickly!

## Our Setup

We opted to project on the wall instead of the floor to save time on figuring
out a proper mounting setup.

* Projector on milk crates
* Webcam on tripod
* Laptop on a box
* Printer on floor
* Wall for the surface medium
* Painter's Tape for safely sticking programs to the wall

## First Steps

We had a Macbook with Node already installed, and started by cloning the [paperprograms repo]:

```sh
# Clone paperprograms
git clone https://github.com/janpaul123/paperprograms
cd paperprograms
```

We didn't already have Postgres installed:

```sh
# Install Postgres
brew install postgresql

# Start Postgres server
# (source: https://stackoverflow.com/a/29383787/142317)
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
```

Paperprograms repo has a `package-lock.json`, so I'm guessing we have to use
the new `npm ci` command ([see npm blog]) to reliably install
correct dependencies, but since our npm version didn't support it, we just used Yarn:

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start server
yarn run dev
```

## Pages

With the server running, the following pages were accessible:

* http://localhost:3000/camera.html - Camera display and calibration
* http://localhost:3000/projector.html - Projector display
* http://localhost:3000/editor.html - Editor for modifying programs

## Opening Camera Page

http://localhost:3000/camera.html

We first opened the camera page above and granted Chrome access to our
camera. Since we had the projector in mirror-mode, we caused some amusing [video feedback]:

## Opening Projector Page

http://localhost:3000/projector.html

We opened the projector page above in a new Chrome window.

To take the projector off of mirror-mode, we just clicked the Airplay icon in the taskbar and clicked "Extend Desktop".

The projector page in Chrome was just black. We dragged it to the projector's designated desktop and full-screened it.

## Calibrating Projection Border

Going back to our camera page, we dragged the corners of the **red
outline**—marked TL, TR, BL, BR—to the outline of the projected page.

The projector page was mostly black, but it actually has a thin gray border
that we used to trace the edges. You can't see the gray border below, because
we dragged the red outline over it:

## Calibrating Dot Colors

From our camera page, we clicked "print calibration page" button, and taped
the page to our wall.

One by one, we clicked a reference color on the right side of the page, then clicked the corresponding dot on the camera.

To see the detected dots better, we had to use the "zoom" slider on the
right, and pan the image by dragging it.

Extra notes:

* We didn't mess with the camera's own color calibration settings.
* The changing sun coming through our window shifted the calibrated colors a bit, so we covered the windows a bit.
* The blue painter's tape was being interpreted as a dot, so we just looped
  the tape onto itself to act as double-sided tape to hide behind the paper.

## Running Hello World

From our camera page, we clicked "create hello world program" button. This
added a program to the print queue, which we clicked to print then taped to
our wall.

The program was detected, but nothing was displaying, until we remembered to enable experimental canvas features in Chrome:

<chrome://flags/> - enable "Experimental canvas features"

"Hello World" was displayed on the page!

## Opening Editor Page

http://localhost:3000/editor.html?9a3eed90 (hash will be different for you)

From our camera page, we copied the editor URL on the right and opened it in a new tab. The editor is hashed presumably to work for multiple camera instances—neat!

From the drop-down on this editor page, we selected the "Hello World"
program, and were able to view/modify/save its code, reproduced below:

```js
importScripts("paper.js");

(async () => {
  // Get a canvas object for this paper.
  const canvas = await paper.get("canvas");

  // Draw "Hello world" on the canvas.
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.font = "20px sans-serif";
  ctx.textAlign = "center";
  ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(255,0,0)";
  ctx.fillText("Hello", canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2 - 10);
  ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0,255,0)";
  ctx.fillText("world", canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2 + 20);
  ctx.commit();

  // Get a "supporter canvas", which is a canvas for the entire
  // projection surface.
  const supporterCanvas = await paper.get("supporterCanvas");
  const supporterCtx = supporterCanvas.getContext("2d");

  // Get the paper number of this piece of paper (which should not change).
  const myPaperNumber = await paper.get("number");

  // Repeat every 100 milliseconds.
  setInterval(async () => {
    // Get a list of all the papers.
    const papers = await paper.get("papers");

    // Clear out the supporter canvas. We get our own canvas, so we won't
    // interfere with other programs by doing this.
    supporterCtx.clearRect(0, 0, supporterCanvas.width, supporterCanvas.height);

    // Draw a circle in the center of our paper.
    const myCenter = papers[myPaperNumber].points.center;
    supporterCtx.fillStyle = supporterCtx.strokeStyle = "rgb(0, 255, 255)";
    supporterCtx.beginPath();
    supporterCtx.arc(myCenter.x, myCenter.y, 10, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
    supporterCtx.fill();

    // Draw a line from our paper to each other paper.
    Object.keys(papers).forEach(otherPaperNumber => {
      if (otherPaperNumber !== myPaperNumber) {
        const otherCenter = papers[otherPaperNumber].points.center;

        supporterCtx.beginPath();
        supporterCtx.moveTo(myCenter.x, myCenter.y);
        supporterCtx.lineTo(otherCenter.x, otherCenter.y);
        supporterCtx.stroke();
      }
    });

    // Finally, commit to the canvas, which actually renders.
    supporterCtx.commit();
  }, 100);
})();
```

Extra notes:

* When in the editor, we realized that the view would stop updating if the Camera tab wasn't open and visible on screen.

## Opening Editors on Multiple Laptops

We all wanted to start messing with Hello World, but when trying to connect to the editor URL from multiple computers, we realized only one editor was allowed to view it at a time.

So we had to create a new program for each of us to play with.

**Creating New Programs**:
The process for creating a new program was weird. We had to go back to the Camera page, and click the "create hello world program" button for each new program we wanted to create. Then we could select it from the dropdown inside the editor.

**Renaming Programs**: This was done by changing the first comment line
inside the code to your desired title, and saving.

**Saving as New Programs**: I think this was done by clicking "print as new paper" button. We ended up clicking this too many times, unknowingly creating multiple program copies.

## What we played with

After two hours of setup, we spent an hour playing with the code.
We all tried different things in parallel while asking each other about API stuff.

We were pretty fascinated by how the canvas was being distorted when cutting
the papers separated the corners, so we experimented a lot with that to see
how it was working.

Amanda stretched the helloworld program (below right). Wanjun added a program
to display an iframe on a page (white pokeman page below) which stretched in
strange ways. We were wondering how the size was being manipulated by the
corners—by stretching or proper resizing of the content.

We later played with animation of shapes and colors:

This is a raw feed from the projector image when moving the papers around:

## Takeaways

Very excited to get it all working and to get a basic understanding of its
behavior! Looking forward to next sessions where we will try a proper
floor/table setup and start playing with more ideas.
