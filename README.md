# Paper Programs at Code Park

We're excited about [Dynamicland]! It is currently only installed in Oakland,
so we wanted to try out a [Paper Programs] installation here in Houston.

## Motivation

During our [Scratch] classes, we saw how some children experienced a bit of
friction navigating and manipulating things in the UI. So we wondered if this
new dynamic table medium would create a better environment for them to play
with these ideas. Potentially:

* [blocks] could be arranged physically on the table
* [costumes] could be drawn on papers

The scope of this exploration will likely change, but the hope is that
exploring this new medium will better inform how we introduce children to
code.
