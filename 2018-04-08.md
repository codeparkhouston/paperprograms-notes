**Pre-session notes**: We might try appending the Paper Programs API to allow:

* Detecting auxiliary objects (with OpenCV): [like the popsicle stick controller here](https://youtu.be/zBzxyUkKo_s?t=42s)
* Reading live camera image (with Canvas): [like this kaleidoscope program](https://youtu.be/cl6FvPFF9CI?t=15s)

_I'm also curious how this relates to Dynamicland's vocabulary of Claims and Wishes to describe its API, heard on [this podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/ahmed-best/the-afrofuturist-podcast/e/53538464)_
